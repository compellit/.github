# COMPEL: Computational Analysis of Peripheral Literatures

Many languages lack adequate computational resources for literary analysis. The COMPEL project will address and study Galician literature – the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages recognises the Galician language – to enhance computational literary analysis resources in lesser-studied traditions. It intends to promote smarter access to cultural heritage, a current EU priority.

The project is hosted at [CiTIUS](https://citius.gal/) (Universidade de Santiago de Compostela).
